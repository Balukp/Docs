# Scaffolded Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

This tutorial examines the Razor Pages created by scaffolding in the [previous tutorial](xref:tutorials/razor-pages/page). 

## The Create, Delete, Details, and Edit pages.

Examine the *Pages/Movie/Index.cshtml* Razor page:

[!code-cshtml[Main](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie/Pages/Movie/Index.cshtml)]

The `@page` makes the file into an MVC action - which means that it can handle requests. @page must be the first Razor directive on a page.

The `@model` directive:

[!code-cshtml[Main](razor-pages-start/sample/RazorPagesMovie/Pages/Movie/Index.cshtml?range=1-2&highlight=2)]

The `@model` line makes the `PageModel` derrived model class available to the Razor Page. The model is used in the `@Html.DisplayNameFor` and `@Html.DisplayNameFor` [HTML Helpers](xref:aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/views/creating-custom-html-helpers-cs#understanding-html-helpers) on the page.

The `Controller` base class has a `ViewData` dictionary property that can be used to add data that you want to pass to a View. You add objects into the `ViewData` dictionary using a key/value pattern.
