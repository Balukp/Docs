# Migrating Authentication and Identity to ASP.NET Core 2.x

<a name="migration-identity"></a>

By [Scott Addie](https://github.com/scottaddie)

With the release of ASP.NET Core 2.0, the most impacted area of the framework is authentication. The 1.x authentication stack is obsolete and **must** be migrated to the 2.0 stack. The most common changes are outlined in the following sections.

<a name="obsolete-interface"></a>

### IAuthenticationManager (HttpContext.Authentication) is obsolete
The `IAuthenticationManager` interface was the main entry point into the 1.x authentication system. It has been replaced with a new set of `HttpContext` extension methods in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication` namespace.

For example, 1.x projects reference an `Authentication` property:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/Controllers/AccountController.cs?name=snippet_AuthenticationProperty)]

In 2.x projects, import the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication` namespace, and delete the `Authentication` property references:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/Controllers/AccountController.cs?name=snippet_AuthenticationProperty)]

<a name="auth-middleware"></a>

### Authentication Middleware
The `UseIdentity` extension method, which typically appeared in the `Configure` method of *Startup.cs* in 1.x projects, is obsolete and will be removed in a future release:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/Startup.cs?range=76)]

Feature parity is maintained in 2.x projects when this method call is replaced with `UseAuthentication`:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/Startup.cs?range=76)]

<a name="identity-cookie-options"></a>

### IdentityCookieOptions Instances
A side effect of the 2.x changes is the switch to using named options instead of cookie options instances. The ability to customize the Identity cookie scheme names is removed.

For example, 1.x projects use [constructor injection](xref:mvc/controllers/dependency-injection#constructor-injection) to pass an `IdentityCookieOptions` parameter into *AccountController.cs*. The external cookie authentication scheme is accessed from the provided instance:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/Controllers/AccountController.cs?name=snippet_AccountControllerConstructor&highlight=4,11)]

The constructor injection becomes unnecessary in 2.x projects, and the `_externalCookieScheme` field can be deleted:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/Controllers/AccountController.cs?name=snippet_AccountControllerConstructor)]

The `IdentityConstants.ExternalScheme` constant can be used directly:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/Controllers/AccountController.cs?name=snippet_AuthenticationProperty)]

<a name="navigation-properties"></a>

### IdentityUser POCO Navigation Properties
The Entity Framework Core navigation properties of the base `IdentityUser` POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) have been removed. If the 1.x project used these properties, manually add them back to the 2.x project:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Navigation property for the roles this user belongs to.
/// </summary>
public virtual ICollection<TUserRole> Roles { get; } = new List<TUserRole>();

/// <summary>
/// Navigation property for the claims this user possesses.
/// </summary>
public virtual ICollection<TUserClaim> Claims { get; } = new List<TUserClaim>();

/// <summary>
/// Navigation property for this users login accounts.
/// </summary>
public virtual ICollection<TUserLogin> Logins { get; } = new List<TUserLogin>();
```

<a name="synchronous-method-removal"></a>

### Removal of GetExternalAuthenticationSchemes
The synchronous method `GetExternalAuthenticationSchemes` was removed in favor of an asynchronous version. 1.x projects have the following code in *ManageController.cs*:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/Controllers/ManageController.cs?name=snippet_ManageLogins&highlight=16)]

In 2.x projects, use the asynchronous version of the method:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/Controllers/ManageController.cs?name=snippet_ManageLogins&highlight=16-17)]

1.x projects reference `GetExternalAuthenticationSchemes` in *Login.cshtml*:

[!code-cshtml[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/Views/Account/Login.cshtml?range=62,75-84)]

In 2.x projects, the asynchronous version of the method is called instead. Switching to this new method means the `AuthenticationScheme` property accessed in the `foreach` loop changes to `Name`.

[!code-cshtml[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/Views/Account/Login.cshtml?range=62,75-84)]

<a name="property-change"></a>

### ManageLoginsViewModel Property Change
A `ManageLoginsViewModel` object is used in the `ManageLogins` action of *ManageController.cs*. In 1.x projects, the object's `OtherLogins` property return type is `IList<AuthenticationDescription>`. This return type requires an import of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication`:

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore1.1App/Models/ManageViewModels/ManageLoginsViewModel.cs?name=snippet_ManageLoginsViewModel&highlight=2,11)]

In 2.x projects, the return type changes to `IList<AuthenticationScheme>`. This new return type requires replacing the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication` import  with a `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication` import.

[!code-csharp[Main](../1x-to-2x/samples/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/AspNetCoreDotNetCore2.0App/Models/ManageViewModels/ManageLoginsViewModel.cs?name=snippet_ManageLoginsViewModel&highlight=2,11)]
